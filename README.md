# AlgorithmsDevelopment_FromScratch

## Aim:
To simulate biochemical reactions in human body for the prediction of drug effect.

## How to reach:
All codes are created from scratch including Differential Evolution algorithm (continuous data) or Genetic Algorithm (discrete data), Model Selection algorithm, Sensitivity Analysis, Stochastic Simulation Analysis, etc.  ODEs was applied from the MATLAB library.

Taking ODEs as the example to simulate biochemical reaction:
